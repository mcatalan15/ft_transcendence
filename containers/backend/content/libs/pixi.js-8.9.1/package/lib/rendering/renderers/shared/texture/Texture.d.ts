 *
 * ```js
 * import { Sprite, Texture } from 'pixi.js';
 *
 * const texture = await Assets.load('assets/image.png');
 * const sprite1 = new Sprite(texture);
 * const sprite2 = new Sprite(texture);
 * ```

 * it subscribes on baseTexture events, it automatically resizes at the same time as baseTexture.
